## **Purpose:**
This Project is used for collection of the current environmental temperature and displaying it on a 8x8 LED display. 
The temperature is calculated according to the Steinhartâ€“Hart equation, based on samples of the resistance, taken from the thermistor.
Update rate is 0.1 seconds.

## **To run the program:**
Upload the code to the Arduino board, using Arduino IDE, and enjoy the show! :)

## **Compatibility:**
Program was compiled and tested in Arduino uno environment.
